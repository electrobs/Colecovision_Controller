## Assembly Tips
  - 3D print using ABS plastic.
    - 100.5% for shell size
    - 100% size for all buttons
  - Single sided PCB
  - Only the smallest diode footprint need to be installed vertically.
  - Screws should be 1/2 inch long at most (from memory, need to double check).
    - Course thread (think small wood screw)
    - 1/8th diameter (from memory, need to double check).
